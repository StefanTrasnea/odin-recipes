                <li>1 (14 ounce) bag corn tortilla chips</li>
                <li>12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>12 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>2 ripe tomato, chopped, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped white onion, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>

            </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the steak: Season both sides of steak with salt and peppers. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak, turning occasionally, to medium doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer meat to a bowl to let it rest.</li>
        <li>Pour a splash of water into the skillet; stir to scrape up browned bits and deglaze the pan. Pour this liquid over meat. Allow meat to cool completely.</li>
        <li>When meat is completely cool, slice thickly (about 1/2 inch) with the grain, then cut into thinner strips. Dice by cutting into pieces against the grain. Transfer chopped steak back to the bowl; toss with the pan drippings.</li>
        <li>Make the beans: Melt bacon fat over medium heat in a pot. Add onion and a pinch of salt; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in oregano. Add pinto beans and water. Bring back to a simmer and cook until onions are soft, about 5 more minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Mash beans with a potato masher to your desired consistency. Add additional liquid if necessary to achieve your preferred texture. Add the remaining salt to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Assemble nachos: Place tortilla chips about 2 or 3 deep in a heat-proof pan. (You may need more than one pan.) Top chips with spoonfuls of beans and a generous handful of steak pieces. Sprinkle with grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges start to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scatter tomato, avocado, onion, and jalapeño over the top. Drizzle nachos with sour cream and garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
